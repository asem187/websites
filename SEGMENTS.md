# Project Segmentation Plan

Below is a proposed breakdown of the AI website builder project into ten segments. Each segment can be assigned to a separate bot or contributor. The tasks reference files and directories in this repository so new work can be committed in a structured way.

## Coordination Guidelines

- Create a **dedicated branch** for each segment so contributions stay isolated.
- Open a **pull request** when a segment is ready for review. Merge sequentially to keep the repo consistent.
- Keep conversations about cross‑segment dependencies in issues or pull request discussions so all bots stay in sync.

## Segment 1 – Research & Requirements (Week 1)
- **Goal:** Expand `README.md` with more examples of AI website builders and summarize their frameworks.
- **Implementation:** Add references to additional projects and note pros/cons.
- **Repo location:** `README.md`

## Segment 2 – Project Structure (Week 1)
- **Goal:** Create directory scaffolding for multiple websites and shared components.
- **Implementation:**
  - Add folders under `sites/` for each planned example site.
  - Create `components/` for reusable templates.
- **Repo location:** `sites/`, `components/`

## Segment 3 – Core Multi‑Agent Pipeline (Weeks 2‑3)
- **Goal:** Flesh out `multi_agent/link_chain.py` with stable agent orchestration.
- **Implementation:**
  - Replace placeholder prompts with production-grade logic.
  - Introduce error handling and logging.
- **Repo location:** `multi_agent/link_chain.py`

## Segment 4 – Template System & Front‑End Framework (Weeks 3‑4)
- **Goal:** Integrate a modern front-end framework (React, Svelte, or Vue) and a CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap.
- **Implementation:**
  - Create a base template in `components/`.
  - Update the pipeline to generate framework-specific files.
- **Repo location:** `components/`, `multi_agent/`

## Segment 5 – Content Generation & LLM Integration (Weeks 4‑5)
- **Goal:** Connect agents to OpenAI's multi-agent API for dynamic content generation.
- **Implementation:**
  - Update each agent in `link_chain.py` to call the API.
  - Allow configuration of models and prompts.
- **Repo location:** `multi_agent/link_chain.py`

## Segment 6 – Accessibility & SEO (Week 6)
- **Goal:** Automate WCAG checks and enrich generated HTML with SEO metadata.
- **Implementation:**
  - Add a script in `tools/` for accessibility and SEO validation.
  - Update the build agent to incorporate these checks.
- **Repo location:** `tools/`, `multi_agent/`

## Segment 7 – Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 7)
- **Goal:** Add unit tests and linting for the Python code and generated sites.
- **Implementation:**
  - Introduce `pytest` tests under `tests/`.
  - Configure linters and formatters in `pyproject.toml` or similar.
- **Repo location:** `tests/`, configuration files

## Segment 8 – Deployment Automation (Week 8)
- **Goal:** Provide scripts to deploy sites to static hosts like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- **Implementation:**
  - Add a deployment script in `tools/deploy.py`.
  - Document usage in `README.md`.
- **Repo location:** `tools/`, `README.md`

## Segment 9 – Example Site Development (Weeks 9‑10)
- **Goal:** Build multiple polished example sites using the pipeline.
- **Implementation:**
  - Commit source files under `sites/` for each demo.
  - Ensure each site passes accessibility and SEO checks.
- **Repo location:** `sites/`

## Segment 10 – Documentation & Final Polishing (Week 11)
- **Goal:** Prepare comprehensive documentation and finalize the repository for release.
- **Implementation:**
  - Update `MARKET_READY_TASKS.md` with completed items.
  - Provide step-by-step instructions for users in `README.md`.
- **Repo location:** `README.md`, `MARKET_READY_TASKS.md`

### Estimated Timeline
Assuming one segment per week (some taking two weeks), the full project could be completed in roughly **11 weeks**. Start dates and exact durations may vary depending on contributor availability. Adjust the schedule as needed when assigning work to different bots.
If work begins in June 2025, final polishing would land around **late August 2025**.
